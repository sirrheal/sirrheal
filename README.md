- üëã Hi, I‚Äôm @sirrheal alluding to cogito ergo sum, whith minor addendums to change from truth, nothing but the truth, to include the whole truth.
- üëÄ I‚Äôm interested in ... paraphrasicly summarizing "Saving the world."
- üå± I‚Äôm currently learning ... as fast as I can. To avoid much worse than the many warnings from Elon Musk. (His are valid, just far better than possible)
- üíûÔ∏è I‚Äôm looking to collaborate on ... Benevolent AI.
- üì´ How to reach me ... hundreds of sites as unrheal, or rheal.notes, since '91.. but that email would be blatantly obvious, even for bots.

Want the start of my life, and only part of why and how very different I am... though friendly, and easy to get along with.. Feel free to read,
if it doesn't bore you too much... there's lots more.


Saving the world from what few believe even a severely watered down version... Against massive odds improved only somewhat by my almost certainly
classifiable as inhumane upbringing after many hours of research of articles and studies chosen only written by specialists, decades later.. 
leading also to learning to program in '78, and AI in '86. Not remembering not being able to read may have helped. (Since I very clearly recall 
being at most 3, just having met my stepmother and her 2 daughters and son (7yo). And shortly after, being alone in a fenced outdoor pool and never 
having seen a pool or any water deeper than a bathtub - fascinated by the bottom blue, staring, someone grabbed my torso from behind and threw me in
the air to stop exactly half way down the center of the 10 foot deep end. (drain grate exactly as far from my feet as the top of my head from the
surface) Beyond shock caused me to yell until about when I stopped - due probably to realizing I couldn't yell for even close to a second
longer, lacking the requisite air. Although those two memories clear as a minute ago were probably ingrained due to the nature. Skipping the 
details, saved multiple times by subconscious actions.. I touched the edge within 1-3 10Th's of a second, giving me a tiny boost to grab, claw,
and pull my way out. Inhaling massively, wit a few drop causing me to choke a bit as I looked around, seeing my new step mother as if a statue,
still leaning against the fence as I first saw her.. and her son 1-2 feet as far from the scene of the crime without being out of the fence.

So I'm not sure if I could read then, except the obvious 10 feet painted across from where I was thrown.. I only have one other vague memory of
my sister teaching me to tie my shoes, and just as I started the train entered a tunnel and it was too dark to see, so she said just wait till we
leave the tunnel.. and when we did, I tied my shoes. No other memories until 1.5+ years after the pool, when regular memories started. 
Forced psychological torture and solitary isolation, my step-bro would taunt me about being so stupid, retarded, etc, that I didn't even deserve
to live and he wished I was dead (never having told anyone about him and his mom watching me drown, only he and I knew how literally he meant it.

Not recalling being taught to read, though, I'd still say 40 hours my dad spent with me is almost laughably generous, as is 6-7 of those we
actually talked.  Including the transistor radio he probably got for my birthday 1.5 years before grade 1. I put it together as he explained the
instructions and was almost shocked to hear static in the earpiece, when I touched the ground wire to a baseboard heater.. since there was no 
battery! Then he explained how the transistor, capacitor and diode were used together for extracting power from the ambient radio waves, and
how the transistor could be used with other transistors to make logic circuits. So as soon as I saw my first computer in grade 6, I knew 
fundamentally how the cpu did logic.

The only three things I recall my step-bro saying-doing besides teasing/taunting me to tears 3-7,8+ times a day for the next 5.5 years or so,
actually showed me how incredibly stupid HE actually was. I guess I was 6 so he was 10 or so, and the parents were out for dinner, no doubt 
for hours. He came up to me with a "see how superior I am and how stupid you are, because I know.. blah" - and said "You know, if you hold 
your arms over your head for more than 15 minutes, they'll fall off!" I knew he didn't joke, and how serious he was saying it.. I just said
that's the stupidest thing I have *ever* heard. So he just said louder - "It's true!"  We were in Hawaii on vacation, and you could look 
through the stairs going up, so I said OK, I'll put my hands on the stairs (as high as I could reach, well over my head) for 20 minutes, no
problem! I could see the gears grinding, and almost the steam from his ears.. until he said: "Well... it might be more like an hour or so.."
And I just said "No problem, I'll stand here for an hour and a half!"
He took the rest of the kids in the kitchen for a few minutes.. The reason I was essentially solitary confinement all those years was because
the only other possible people I could theoretically talk to were the other kids - but they were all his "group" and saw how someone not in his
group was treated, and I don't blame them for not wanting that! - Literally life long psychological damage, and let me know if you want hoards
of references - articles and studies from professional psychiatrists specialists in proper socialization of a child's first 5 years. Many say
of the first 5 critical years of socialization.. and the effects... anyway.. after a few minutes, he did the lowest, only thing he could do
that would work. Only one of them was my real sister.. he got her to come out and beg me to take my arms down.. just for her. There was
Literally nothing else he could have done. Coming up with that was by FAR the smartest thing he ever did.

One other time he and I were told by his mom, the only other one home, to go somewhere and play.. we walked into the back yard, which seemed
to start a forest... we went in 60 feet or so and it was just trees and branches everywhere. So he stopped and started to climb a tree, and
said "I bet I can climb higher than you!" - So I looked up, picked a tree 20 feet taller than the one he was climbing, and said OK!

I won't bore you with the one other stupid thing he did, but me not even really trying to socialize until about grade 3 - And was a bit amazed
that having been kicked out to live with my mother after grade 1, and so started in another school (not in the middle of nowhere) that part way 
into grade 2, the teacher brought out these books that were about 45 pages with a big picture and two to four lines at the bottom of each page, 
and started to try and teach us how to read! Each kid was to read one sentence and taking about a minute each. (each one seemed to have one or
two words that weren't pronounced as they were spelled.. still after a couple pages and almost 5 minutes, I read the rest of the book, just to
be sure, in less than a minute, easily.. then ducked around the corner where our coats and packs were, and got my current (prob. sci. fi.) book
and ducked back in and read it as I pretended to follow along. Of course she noticed I wasn't really following after a few minutes, and said
"Aren't you going to follow along..?"  So I told her I read it already and it was quite boring, so I got my own book to read - and showed her.
I think she asked me to read for 10 or 15 seconds, and then said.. ok, don't worry, you can read your book.

Plus, really only starting to socialize and make a few friends in gr. 3... makes a big difference how you see socialization, when you have to
*start* to learn it After you could alread think.
