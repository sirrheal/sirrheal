- üëã Hi, I‚Äôm @sirrheal alluding to cogito ergo sum, whith minor addendums to change from truth, nothing but the truth, to include the whole truth.
- üëÄ I‚Äôm interested in ... paraphrasicly summarizing "Saving the world."
- üå± I‚Äôm currently learning ... as fast as I can. To avoid much worse than the many warnings from Elon Musk. (His are valid, just far better than possible)
- üíûÔ∏è I‚Äôm looking to collaborate on ... Benevolent AI.
- üì´ How to reach me ... hundreds of sites as unrheal, or rheal.notes, since '91.. but that email would be blatantly obvious, even for bots.

Want the start of my life, and only part of why and how very different I am... though friendly, and easy to get along with.. Feel free to read,
if it doesn't bore you too much... there's lots more.


Saving the world from what few believe even a severely watered down version... Against massive odds improved only somewhat by my almost certainly
classifiable as inhumane upbringing I realized after many hours of research of articles and studies chosen only written by specialists, decades later 
how it can damage you to not be socialized "properly" for the initial 5 years. 

At least it probably helped leading to learn how to program in '78, not a student, staff, or teacher in the entire school knew a single thing about
computers except one adult I didn't know must have noticed my interest, since he gave me the manual and said this can teach you how to use it, and 
program in BASIC on it, and even save and load your files onto a cassette tape using the cassette tape drive, built in. And left. 

One grade 12 student in high school knew how to program the Prime minicomputer that connected the dozen or so high schools in the area. He showed me 
a few things, but was always busy, and then gone. The next year - grade 10, the guy who became my best friend through the rest of high school, and the 
only other person who seemed interested in computers. Together, we learned how to program the Apple ][+'s in machine language. But you had to run the
program and enter your instructions and any parameters straight into memory in hex, like EA CC 2F and you could save and load your files on 5 1/4 inch
floppies - progress! Also where you could enter your hex codes for your program, it also had (I'm pretty sure) the most fundamental possible debugger, 
that would still function. (the one the jerk in the store a year earlier didn't even bother to tell me about.. You could enter breakpoints, step, step
over, or in, and a few others, that's it. When I got my first Apple ][+ the year before - we were in the store at one point, and on a screen was a full
assembly language IDE and everything. I said how cool that looked, can I do it? And that was the jerk that just said it's an assembly programmer, and 
it's expensive.. And didn't even tell me about the built in hex code entry and debugger. 

But back a year later - I had a favorite game I got for xmas or bday or some such. So when my best friend and I found out about the debugger - we actually
tried loading my game, and we debugged it for some time, and finally one time we tried changing a Jump code to a NOP (no operation) - then suddenly we
could run it without the disk in. We broke the copy protection. It was great.. still - not one student, (except my best friend - he did way better than 
me in all the lame classes, but then he did pay attention and actually did homework) nor a teacher or staff had any knowledge whatsoever about computers.
The comp sci teacher was a math teacher who dropped in for 5-10 minutes every week or two. Finally! After high school, I just signed up at the local tech
institute, and the college.. and just went through the course catalog each semester and too two or three courses that seemed interesting even starting AI
courses in '86. 

I never recall not being able to read, though my first two crystal clear 5-10 minute memories. (second was a bit hard to judge the time, as it was.) Since
I very clearly recall being at most 3, just having met my stepmother and her 2 daughters and son (7yo). And shortly after, being alone in a fenced outdoor
pool and never having seen a pool or any water deeper than a bathtub - fascinated by the bottom blue, staring, someone grabbed my torso from behind and
threw me in the air to stop exactly half way down the center of the 10 foot deep end - (the 10 feet being the only thing I had to read.) The drain grate
was exactly as far from my feet as the top of my head was from the surface. Beyond shock caused me to yell until about when I stopped - probably due 
partly to realizing I couldn't yell for longer, almost totally out of air! Also being maybe 30 lbs, and anti-boyant skin and bones, but no air. I'll 
skip all the longer, boring details of almost drowning. Although those two memories clear as a minute ago were probably ingrained due to the nature.
Skipping the details, saved multiple times by subconscious actions.. I touched the edge within 1-3 10Th's of a second, giving me a tiny boost to grab,
claw, and pull my way out. Inhaling massively, wit a few drop causing me to choke a bit as I looked around, seeing my new step mother as if a statue,
still leaning against the fence as I first saw her.. and her son 1-2 feet as far from the scene of the crime as he could be, without being out of the
fence.

So I'm not sure if I could read then, except the obvious 10 feet painted across from where I was thrown.. I only have one other vague memory of
my sister teaching me to tie my shoes, and just as I started the train entered a tunnel and it was too dark to see, so she said just wait till we
leave the tunnel.. and when we did, I tied my shoes. No other memories until 1.5+ years after the pool, when regular memories started. 
Forced psychological torture and solitary isolation, my step-bro would taunt me about being so stupid, retarded, etc, that I didn't even deserve
to live and he wished I was dead (never having told anyone about him and his mom watching me drown, only he and I knew how literally he meant it.

I'd still say 40 hours my dad spent with me over the 5.5 years or so, is almost laughably generous, as is 6-7 of those we
actually talked.  Including the transistor radio he probably got for my birthday 1.5 years before grade 1. I put it together as he helped explained the
instructions, since it wasn't all reading.. and was almost shocked to hear static in the earpiece, when I touched the ground wire to a baseboard heater..
since there was no battery! Then he explained how the transistor, capacitor and diode were used together for extracting power from the ambient radio 
waves, and how the transistor could be used with other transistors to make logic circuits. So as soon as I saw my first computer in grade 6, I knew
fundamentally how the cpu did logic.

The only three things I recall my step-bro saying-doing besides teasing/taunting me to tears 3-7,8+ times a day for the next 5.5 years or so,
actually showed me how incredibly stupid HE actually was. I guess I was 6 so he was 10 or so, and the parents were out for dinner, no doubt 
for hours. He came up to me with a "see how superior I am and how stupid you are, because I know.. blah" - and said "You know, if you hold 
your arms over your head for more than 15 minutes, they'll fall off!" I knew he didn't joke, and how serious he was saying it.. I just said
that's the stupidest thing I have *ever* heard. So he just said louder - "It's true!"  We were in Hawaii on vacation, and you could look 
through the stairs going up, so I said OK, I'll put my hands on the stairs (as high as I could reach, well over my head) for 20 minutes, no
problem! I could see the gears grinding, and almost the steam from his ears.. until he said: "Well... it might be more like an hour or so.."
And I just said "No problem, I'll stand here for an hour and a half!"
He took the rest of the kids in the kitchen for a few minutes.. The reason I was essentially solitary confinement all those years was because
the only other possible people I could theoretically talk to were the other kids - but they were all his "group" and saw how someone not in his
group was treated, and I don't blame them for not wanting that! - Literally life long psychological damage, and let me know if you want hoards
of references - articles and studies from professional psychiatrists specialists in proper socialization of a child's first 5 years. Many say
of the first 5 critical years of socialization.. and the effects... anyway.. after a few minutes, he did the lowest, only thing he could do
that would work. Only one of them was my real sister.. he got her to come out and beg me to take my arms down.. just for her. There was
Literally nothing else he could have done. Coming up with that was by FAR the smartest thing he ever did.

One other time he and I were told by his mom, the only other one home, to go somewhere and play.. we walked into the back yard, which seemed
to start a forest... we went in 60 feet or so and it was just trees and branches everywhere. So he stopped and started to climb a tree, and
said "I bet I can climb higher than you!" - So I looked up, picked a tree 20 feet taller than the one he was climbing, and said OK!

I won't bore you with the couple of REALLY stupid things he did... And was a bit amazed
that having been kicked out to live with my mother after grade 1, and so started in another school (not in the middle of nowhere) that part way 
into grade 2, the teacher brought out these books that were about 45 pages with a big picture and two to four lines at the bottom of each page, 
and started to try and teach us how to read! Each kid was to read one sentence and taking about a minute each. (each one seemed to have one or
two words that weren't pronounced as they were spelled.. still after a couple pages and almost 5 minutes, I read the rest of the book, just to
be sure, in less than a minute, easily.. then ducked around the corner where our coats and packs were, and got my current (prob. sci. fi.) book
and ducked back in and read it as I pretended to follow along. Of course she noticed I wasn't really following after a few minutes, and said
"Aren't you going to follow along..?"  So I told her I read it already and it was quite boring, so I got my own book to read - and showed her.
I think she asked me to read for 10 or 15 seconds, and then said.. ok, don't worry, you can read your book.

Plus, really only starting to socialize and make a few friends in gr. 3... makes a big difference how you see socialization, when you have to
*start* to learn it After you could alread think.
